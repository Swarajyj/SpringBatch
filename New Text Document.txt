1)What is job and step?
-each job can have multiple steps


Step types
----------
1)Tasklet step (simple task)
2)Chunk-Oriented step (reading 1000 lines for eg from csv)
Chunk step =
    Item Reader +
    Item Processor + (not always necessary )
    Item Writer 



Different types of item readers present in spring batch (in-build)

Spring batch architecture:
--------------------------


How to create job and step?
-Job Builder Factory and Step Builder Factory.

Structure(Take diagram from udemy lecture 14)
-------------------------------------------
Job
Job Instances (01 March, 02 March) - one per day
Job Execution (Store job information like when start end, end time and status) - can happen many times if run was failure.)
Execution Context
-----------------
1)Job Execution Context - to pass data within a job.(to pass data withing steps)
2)Data stored at the end of job.
3)Key value pair


Step
Step Execution (Store step information like when start end, end time and status) - can happen many times if run was failure.)

Execution Context
-----------------
1)Step Execution Context - to pass data within a step.
2)Key value pair.

will look for the table if present, if its present it wont create new tables.

Tables created:
---------------
BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE - Stores thejob key of instance with job name.
BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION - Stores the status of job Start_time ,end_time, Status with job instance id.
BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_CONTEXT - stores map with job_excution_id.
BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_PARAMS - 
BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION - Stores step name with job_execution_id , start time , end time and status.
BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT - Stores map with step_execution_id from BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION.

Note:
-----
If one job execution status is complete under a job instance, it will not run when you try second time(no second job execution).
-To avoid this we can use job parameter, to give unique job instance id.
-use RunIdIncrementer() for getting new job parameter everytime.

Question , What is use of RunIdIncrementer()?

In chunk oriented step processor is optional, rest 2 compulsory

We can combine tasklet step and chunk oriented step together in a job.
